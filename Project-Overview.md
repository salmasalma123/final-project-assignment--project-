# Project Overview

## Project Goals and Motivation
- **Project Goals**: The primary goal of our project is to develop an automated system for detecting defective circular storage containers on a production line.
- **Motivation**:This project aims to improve quality control in manufacturing, reduce defects, and enhance efficiency.

## Hardware and Software Selections
- **Build System**: We have selected Buildroot as our build system for its flexibility and ease of customization.
- **Hardware Platform**: Our project will run on a custom ARM-based embedded system.

## Open-Source Projects
We plan to leverage OpenCV for image processing and TensorFlow for machine learning. Here are the links to their repositories:
    - [OpenCV Repository](https://github.com/opencv/opencv)
    - [TensorFlow Repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)

## Previous Assignment Content
We will build upon the image preprocessing techniques developed in Assignment 2 for our defect detection algorithm.

## Course Content Integration
We will apply the knowledge gained in the 'Image Processing' module to enhance our image analysis and defect detection algorithms.

## New or Uncovered Content
We plan to implement a real-time data streaming module, which has not been covered in the course. This will enable us to collect and process data from sensors on the production line.
